# Find Median Of Two Sorted Arrays

## To find the median of two sorted arrays, you can follow the steps below:

1. Combine the two arrays into a single sorted array.
2. Calculate the length of the combined array.
3. If the length is odd, the median will be the value at index length/2.
4. If the length is even, the median will be the average of the values at indexes length/2 and length/2 - 1.
